Text Classification and Prediction
Introduction
This repository contains code for performing text classification and prediction using machine learning techniques. The code is designed to work with text data and includes steps for preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and prediction.

Getting Started
To get started, follow the steps below:

Install Required Libraries:

To run the code, you'll need to install several Python libraries. You can install them using pip:


pip install opendatasets
pip install nltk

Dataset Download:

The code uses a dataset from "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database" for text classification. You can download the dataset using the OpenDatasets library after storing in kaggle :


Data Preprocessing:

The code includes several preprocessing steps for text data, including converting text to lowercase, removing numbers, punctuation, and extra whitespaces. These steps are crucial for cleaning and preparing the text data for further processing.

Text Vectorization:

Text data is converted into a numerical format using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. This step is essential for machine learning models to work with text data.

Model Training:

The code includes the training of two machine learning models:

Multinomial Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Both models are trained to classify text data into predefined categories.

Model Evaluation:

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices. This allows you to assess how well the models perform on the given dataset.

Text Prediction:

After training the models, you can use them to make predictions on new text data. The code provides an example of how to preprocess and predict the category of a piece of text.

Usage
To use the code for your own text classification tasks, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset or use the provided example dataset.

Modify the code to fit your specific dataset and classification categories.

Train and evaluate the models based on your dataset.

Use the trained models to make predictions on new text data.

Dependencies
The code relies on several Python libraries, including:

scikit-learn
pandas
matplotlib
nltk
Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the code.
